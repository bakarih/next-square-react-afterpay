# web-payments-sdk-types

@square/web-payments-sdk-types is package of TypeScript type definitions for the [Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/overview).

The types defined in this package are documented in the [Developer Reference for Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments).

## Use

This package uses declaration files (`d.ts`). Once this package is added to the [typeRoots](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#typeRoots) as part of the `tsconfig.json`, initiating a payments instance using `window.Square.payments` will provide typechecking and autocompletion automatically.
Developers can also import any type definition listed in the [developer reference](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments).
