   * A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this
   * exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the
   * amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.
   * Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such
   * as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`
   * field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.
   * Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:
   * The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed
   * in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use
   * the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.
   * *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a
   * merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the
   * associated payment.
   * When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is
   * reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of
   * `SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the
   * associated payment.
